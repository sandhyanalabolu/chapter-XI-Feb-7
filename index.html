        <h2>Probabilistic or Stochastic Process</h2>
        <hr><br>
        <p>“Probability or stochastic process” is a name used to designate mathematical
models that represent the behavior of phenomena described by probability
theory, ranging from a simple game of coin tossing up to more complex
phenomenon like “Brownian motion theory”, “investment analysis”, etc.
Stochastic process uses mathematical models to represent phenomena ruled by
the probabilistic variation of some variable over time.</p>
        <p>Simulation methods, also known as Monte Carlo methods, are stochastic
processes that use mathematical models that have similar behavior of real
problems, feeding these models with random values generated according to
some probability distribution. The term Monte Carlo is used as a synonym for
simulation since in some problems the generation of probabilistic values was
            historically linked to the use of the roulette wheel.</p>
        <p>In this chapter we show how simulation method can be used to evaluate
complex decision problems involving uncertainty. This kind of problem involves</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>knowledge of probability distribution (such as uniform, Poisson, or Normal
distribution) used to represent the probabilistic process and the value of
respective parameters (such as the average value and the standard deviation).
Simulation is the most appropriate tool for visualizing, testing, and evaluating the
parameters and the dynamic behavior of a probabilistic process. Simulation
uses algorithms that generate a population of probabilistic events which makes
possible the estimation of the values of parameters of the problem. The results
of a simulation can be proven to be valid approximations of the values of the real
phenomenon which they simulate.</p>
        <h1>Using Simulation to Compare
Multiple-Stage Strategic Decisions</h1><hr>
        <p>In previous chapters, several aspects of decision problems, involving the choice
of the best alternative, uncertainties, multiple scenarios, multiple goals, etc.,
have been studied. However those were cases of decision for only one stage.
Many complex strategic-decision problems are formed by a dynamic sequence
of decision problems involving multiple stages of decisions. These problems are
more appropriately represented using a decision tree, and simulation is used
to make comparisons of different strategies along the decision tree.<br>
Let us consider the following two-stage strategies:</p><br>
        <h2>Strategy A</h2><br>
        <p><b>Stage one:</b> Invest in a high-risk stock whose payoff (Payoff-A) can be
negative or positive values. Past data show that the payoff value varies from -
$100 (maximum loss) to +$100 (maximum profit);</p>
        <h2>Stage two:</h2>
        <p>a. if Payoff-A is a positive value less than $50, then the investor must pay $30
as expenses, or if Payoff-A is a positive value greater than $50, then the
investor must pay $50 as expenses;</p>
        <p>b. if Payoff-A is a negative value between $0 and (-$50), then the investor
must pay $20 as expenses, or if Payoff-A is a negative value less than (-
$50), then the investor pays $0 as expenses.</p><br><hr><br>
        <br><h2>Strategy B</h2>
        <p><b>Stage one: </b>Invest in a high-risk stock whose payoff (Payoff-B) can be negative
or positive values. Past data show that the payoff value varies from -$120
(maximum loss) to +$120 (maximum profit);</p>
        <h2>Stage two:</h2>
        <p>a. if Payoff-B is a positive value less than $60, then the investor must pay $30
as expenses, or if Payoff-B is a positive value greater than $60, then the
investor must pay $50 as expenses;</p>
        <p>b. if Payoff-B is a negative value between $0 and (-$60), then the investor
must pay $20 as expenses, or if Payoff-B is a negative value less than
(-$60), then the investor pays $0 as expenses.</p><br>
        <p>In this simple project, the selection of strategy A or B depends on the results
of the following events:</p>
        <p>a. “Payoff-A” and “Payoff-B”, with two possible results: positive or negative
values;</p>
        <p>b. “positive value of Payoff A or B” results in two possible values for
expenses;</p>
        <p>c. “negative value of Payoff A or B” also results in two possible expenses;
which provide 2·2·2 = 8 possible results.</p><br>
        <h2>Stochastic Analysis to Compare Two Similar Strategies</h2><hr>
        <p>The analysis of a probabilistic decision problem to a broader band of variation
of the parameter values is made by a simulation study, using probability
distribution attributed to each value of the estimated parameter.</p>
        <p>The estimated value of a parameter is used as the mean or average value of the
distribution. Asking an expert, it is possible to define an “upper limit” for this
average, such that only 5% of the possible values of this parameter surpass this
upper limit. In a similar fashion, it is possible to define a “lower limit” such that
only 5% of the possible values will be lower than this limit. In probability terms,
this procedure corresponds to defining a confidence interval for the average
value with 90% confidence.</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>If the decision maker and the expert agree that the average value provided by
the estimate is located in a symmetric position with relation to these two limits,
the normal distribution can be used. If not, one can evaluate the possibility of
using other type of distributions such as the exponential, log-normal, beta,
gamma distribution, etc.</p>
        <p>In our case, we are assuming that the value of the Payoffs (negative or positive
values) has a normal distribution with the average equal to the value estimated
by the expert and the standard deviation equals to 25% of the difference
between this average and one of the limits found. In the case of normal
distribution an interval defined by the expression m ± 4s (the average value
plus and minus four times the standard deviation) corresponds to approximately
90% of the possibilities of occurrence of the values of this distribution.</p>
        <p>Using these distributions the first stage of strategy A and B becomes:</p><br>
        <h2>Strategy A</h2><br>
        <p><b>Stage one:</b> Invest in a high-risk stock whose payoff (Payoff-A) is distributed<br>
according:</p>
        <p>To N (= $0,  = $25), a Normal distribution with average value and
standard deviation equal to $0 and $25, respectively; and</p><br>
        <h2>Strategy B</h2>
        <p>Stage one: Invest in a high-risk stock whose payoff (Payoff-B) is distributed<br>
        according:</p>
        <p>To N (= $0,  = $30), a Normal distribution with average value and
standard deviation equal to $0 and $30, respectively.</p>
        <p>We are admitting that events in stage two do not involve probability distribution.
Payoff’s normal distribution functions and decision trees for strategies A and
B are as shown in Figure 11.1.</p>
        <p>The simulation process to generate the Net values (Payoff minus expenses) for
both strategies A and B is the following:</p><br><hr><br>
        <p><i>Figure 11.1. Payoff-A and Payoff-B probability distributions and the<br>
            decision tree</i></p>
        <img src="image1.html.jpg" style="height:500px;width: 600px;">
        <p>• generate a normally distributed random value (using an algorithm or
            appropriate software for simulation);</p>
<p>• using this random value make appropriate calculation of stage two to have
the final net value (positive or negative) for the strategy A or B.</p>
        <p>For example, if the Payoff-A value generated is $76, the expenditure will be
$50 and then the net value is $26; if Payoff-B value is -$67, the expenditure is
zero and the final net value is -$67, and so on.</p>

and 30 events for B. The first column of this table shows intervals for the net</p><br><hr><br>

        <p>values (from negative to positive values), the second and third columns show
the frequency (number of occurrences) and the probability (p(A)= frequency
divided by 30) of final net value in each interval. In the fourth column, the values
of cumulative probability distribution function (CDF(A)) are registered. The
values of CDF will be used for the comparison of the two strategies using the
stochastic dominance technique. Table 11.1 contains also the same values for
strategy B.</p>
        <p>Placing the two strategies on the same graph of cumulative probability distribution
function, we get the graph of “stochastic dominance” in which it is
possible to compare the two strategies (Figure 11.2). This comparison is based
on the fact that:</p>
        <p><i>If a cumulative probability distribution value of a strategy is to
the right of the cumulative probability distribution value of another
strategy for a value of an event, this means that this strategy
has smaller probability of occurrence than the other strategy of the
event considered.</i></p>
        <p>In Figure 11.2, we can see that “strategy B” (indicated by arrowsŁ) has
stochastic dominance over “strategy A” (indicated by curves), because CDF
curve for B is always located to the left of CDF curve for strategy A. This means
that strategy B has greater probability to have negative net values but also
            greater probability to have positive net values than strategy A.</p>
<p>We need to compare both the lengths of the ranges for which a strategy is
dominant and the differences between the CDF values. This comparison can be</p><br><hr><br>
        <p><i>Figure 11.2. Graph of stochastic dominance between strategy A and
            strategy B</i></p>

        <p>made using the sizes of the areas defined between the two CDF curves. For
instance, the area defined by CDF curves B and A for the positive net values,
looks smaller than the area defined for the negative values. This means that
strategy B has more possibility to have negative net values than positive values.
Further analysis of stochastic dominance requires the use of other probabilistic
techniques (see, for instance Goodwin & Wright, 1996).</p>
        <p>The probabilities of occurrence of each event need to be estimated in a
subjective mode, referring to the opinion of an expert involved in the project.
The expert can attribute the probability values to each node of the decision tree
by examining each node from left (starting node) to the right of the decision tree.
Usually strategic projects are represented by complex decision trees with many
branches and nodes. The estimation of probabilities made in each node may be
dependent or independent of the estimate made in previous nodes. If dependency
exists, one must estimate the probability of the event conditioned to the
occurrence of events in previous nodes. This fact causes difficulties in the
development of the subjective reasoning of the expert, leading to unlikely
estimates. The subjective estimates of conditional probabilities in each node
may lead to a biased estimation of the probabilities in the final events of the
decision tree.</p>
        <p>A more natural and logical procedure is to attribute the probability values,
exploring the decision tree from the end to the beginning, that is, from right to</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>left. For example, an expert consulted about the probability of success of a
project to launch a new product may estimate that, based in his or her
knowledge about market demand for this type of product, the probability of
success of this project is, for instance, P(Success) = 0.7 and then the
probability of failure will be P (Failure) = 0.3. After fixing these values, the
expert can estimate the probability of events located in the antecessor nodes to
the events Success and Failure. After admitting of some “facts” (or the
probability of their occurrence) it seems easier to estimate the probabilities of
the events that caused these facts.</p>
        <p>The following case study illustrates the assessment of probability values in a
complex decision tree.</p><br>
        <h1>Business Game Simulates
Competition Among Companies</h1><hr><br>
        <P>Long-term conflict or competition occurs when companies or countries find
themselves in prolonged confrontation such as in the market share problem. It
is necessary to establish a line of action or a decision sequence to take best
advantage of each stage of competition. A decision in situation of competition
can be examined by simulation software known as BUSINESS GAME.
Business games have been formerly created based on the experience of
strategic competition found in models of war games. In business games, the
concepts of victory or defeat used in war games are replaced by the analysis
of the behavior of the companies involved in competition, expressed in terms
of economical results over a certain period of time.<br>
A business game can be defined as:</P>
        <p><i>A sequential decision making exercise structured using a business
strategy model or operational model, where participants
assume the role of managers.</i></p>
        <p>The term “game” always connotes competition, but business game’s main
purpose is to systematically train the participants in the sense to have better
understanding of the business strategies and operations using virtual business
competition environments simulated in a computer. Competition arises as a</p><br><hr><br>
        <P>stimulus to create an environment of interest for understanding and testing
alternatives for the simulated strategies or operations.<br>
The “game” cannot be seen as an entertainment, as is the case of video games.
The business game forms part of Game Theory, created by Von Neumann and
Morgenstern, which is a mathematical model used to represent a situation of
conflict in a general way.</P>
        <p>Business game creates a complex environment with uncertainty simulating the
alternatives for business decisions. Business game is a useful tool for demonstrating,
testing, and training strategic decision making in companies, because
it retains the effect of the diffusion of the results of a decision through future
periods, taking into account the participation of rival companies.<br>
The advantages of a business game are:</p>
        <p>• it creates appropriate training conditions and environments for executive
and manager’s decision-making process which are difficult to have by
            other tools;</p>
<p>• it allows for the repetition of the conditions for analyzing a decision under
    different economic and financial aspects;</p>
<p>• it permits testing of the different alternatives for an strategy or operation
using different organizational structures for individuals, groups, functional
    hierarchy, etc;</p>
<p>• it allows interactive mid or long-term projection of the results of a strategic
policy.</p>
        <p>Some disadvantages are:</p>
        <p>􀂇<b> Cost and time factors:</b> the cost of a software is high and the time spent
to play a business game is long, since it requires several rounds of plays
conducted by a team of professionals to operate the software;</p>
        <p>􀂇<b> Validity of the results and training:</b> even though practicing the game
clarifies the company’s strategic or functional mechanism, there is not a
valid evidence that results of the game or the performance of game players
will necessarily be repeated in real problems;</p>
        <p> Danger of rashness: the mechanism of the simulation is regulated by
mathematical equations of micro and macro economy theory. Some
factors can be stressed over others, such as the importance of the low</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>price of the product, investment in advertisement or R&D, etc. to leverage
the financial results of the game, without having fully taken into account all
the complex effects of these factors.</p>
        <h2>Games for Competition</h2><hr>
        <p><i>Game One: Competition Between Two Companies Having Different
Material Resources (adapted from Kinoshita, 1996)</i></p>
        <p>Let’s consider the competition between two companies BURGER-A and
            BURGER-B with respect to the number of sales points.</p>
<p>BURGER-A (designated as A) has a sales points while BURGER-B (designated
    as B) has b sales points.</p>
<p>The game consists in taking or losing the sales points through competitions
simulated by tossing a coin. Thus,</p>
        <p>• if HEADS occurs, A wins the first competition and takes possession of
            one of B’s sales points and</p>
<p>• if TAILS occurs, B takes possession of one of A’s sales points.</p>
        <p>The game ends when one of the companies loses all its sales points. For
instance, starting with the values a = 2 and b = 1 we have:</p>
    <h2>a. First competition:</h2>
        <p>If HEADS occurs, then A wins and stays witha= 3 andb = 0 and we have
a VICTORY FOR A, or<br>
If TAILS occurs, then B wins with a= 1 and b = 2 and we will have the
second competition.</p>
        <h2>b. Second competition:</h2>
        <p>HEADS: A wins with a= 2 and b = 1 and the game returns to the same
situation of the first competition, or<br>
TAILS: B wins with a = 0 and b = 3 and we have a VICTORY FOR B.</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>For every two competitions there exists a return to the first competition with
probability P (return to first competition) = ¼, forming an infinite sequence of
these two competitions.</p>
        <h2>General Formulas for Game One</h2>
        <p>For any value ofaeb it is possible to show, using mathematical approximation
of infinite series, that</p><br>
        <p>P(Victory for A) = a / (a + b) and P(Victory for B) = b / (a + b).</p>
        <p>Thus, the probability of victory is directly proportional to the value of its
available resource (aand b) if the chance of winning a competition is equal for
both companies.</p>
        <p><i>Game Two: Competition Between two Companies with Different
Material Resources and Different Chances of Winning a Competition</i>p>
 <p>Let’s consider that, in addition to establishing the value aand b for material
resources, we can also fix different chances of winning each competition, with
probability P(A wins one competition) = a and P(B wins one competition) =<b>
     a = b.</b>/p>
     <p>What are the chances of VICTORY for each company?<br>
For instance,</p>
        <p>if a = 1, b = 1 , a = 2/3 and b= 1 – a = 1/3, then we could have<br>
P(A wins) = 2/3 with a = 2 and b = 0, and have a VICTORY FOR A or<br>
P(B wins) = 1/3 with a = 0 and b = 1, and have a VICTORY FOR B.</p>
        <h2>General Formulas for Game Two</h2>
        <p>Using mathematical approximations based on the Gambler’s Ruin Problem of
Probability Theory ( Feller, W. – An Introduction to Probability Theory and its
Applications – 2nd Edition, Wiley, 1957, p. 314) it is possible to show that:</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>P(Victory of A) = [ 1 – (b/a) a ] / [ 1 – (b/a) a+ b] and<br>
P(Victory of B) = 1 – P(Victory of A)</p>
        <p>and b are the material resources of A and B and a and b are the probabilities
of victory for A and B in a single competition.</p>.

            <h2>A General Purpose Business Game</h2><hr>
        <p>The basic form of a general purpose model of BUSINESS GAME [Naylor &

        <h1>Continuous System Simulation</h1><hr>
        <p>A discrete-event simulation becomes complex when each equation involves
several variables of the problems simultaneously. One approach to simplify the
numerical calculations is to consider a set of simultaneous algebraic equations
or differential equations. Periods of time are advanced in uniform steps, and a
model of the system is represented in the form of difference or differential
equations. The variables of the model representing the attributes of the system
            entities are controlled by continuous equations.</p>
<p>ulation of a continuous system is largely used to control complex or
nonlinear engineering problems, or econometric models. Particular interest in</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>using simulation of continuous systems relies in the fact that behavior of a system
can be controlled through the coupling between the input and output of the
            system. The term feedback is used to describe this phenomenon.</p>
<p>ustrial Dynamics and Business Dynamics are models used to simulate
complex industrial and business systems. Industrial Dynamics is a term created
by Professor J. W. Forrester of MIT (Forrester, 1961), aiming to study the
characteristics and the performance of business corporations or one entire
industry. Business Dynamics is a term used by Professor J. D Sterman of MIT
(Sterman, 2000), extending the research on system dynamics for advanced
models of the business system. The illustrative example of Industrial Dynamics
Model of an Inventory Control System (Forrester, 1969), shown in the
following section, is based on the description and results presented by Gordon
(1978).</p>
    <h2>Industrial Dynamics Model of an Inventory Control
System<h2><hr>
        <p>A simple model of the inventory control system can be defined by the following
system of two ordinary first-order differential equations:</p><br>
        <p>Y’ = U – V and X’ = V – S</p><br>
        <p>V is the equation for the rate of delivery V = Y / T1, and U is the order rate
expressed by</p><br>
        <p>U = S + K (I – X).</p><br>
        <p>X is the current inventory level, Y is the outstanding level of orders placed with
the supplier, U is the rate of ordering from supplier, V is the rate of delivery from
supplier, and S is the rate of sales. In addition, three constants need to be
defined: I is the prefixed planned inventory level, T1 is the average delivery
            time, and K is a constant called ordering constant.</p>
<p>The ordering  po introduces feedback and the value of K corresponds to the
amplification in the feedback loop. The value of K, along with the value of T1,
will determine if the system oscillates or not.</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>This problem can be solved using a continuous system modeling language like
DYNAMO, or directly using a numerical method for a system of two first-order
differential equations, like Runge-Kutta method. The graphics shown in the
Figure 11.3 corresponds to the partial results presented in Gordon (1978)
using the IBM 360/CSMP (Continuous System Modeling Program).</p>
        <p>Assume that a time is measured in units of days, and let the system be initialized
at time t = 0, with the following initial conditions:</p><br>
        <p>I = X = 20 units; Y = 12 units; S = 4 items/day and T1 = 3 days.</p>
        <p>Suppose the demand suddenly increases at time t = 4 to S = 6 items/day. The
oscillations of inventory level for some values of K (K = 1 or 0.5) are shown
in Figure 11.3.</p>
        <p>Inventory level X (initial value X = 20 for t = 0).</p>

            <h1>Case Study: Strategy and
Decisions in Perspective</h1><hr>
        <h2>Case – The Struggle Against Uncertainty</h2><hr>
        <p>For most of human history, people have had nothing more than instinct and
superstition to guide them in the face of uncertainty. The greatest of mathematicians
among the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Greeks, the Romans and the
wise persons of the Middle Ages never considered whether it was worth it to
spend time measuring or managing risk, accepting uncertainty as a fatalism.
Even the gambling was practiced by rules that seemed arbitrary to anyone with
an elementary knowledge of probability.</p>
        <p>Things began to change during the Renaissance and the Reformation period,
when there were changes in the way of thinking about the future. In 1654, the
mathematicians Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat used mathematics to
analyze a simple game of chance —– and thus created the basis for the theory
of probability. The discoveries and developments of sampling techniques,
utility, regression, and correlation, provided a solid foundation to make a
rational assessment of risk management.</p>
        <p>However, the advances of modern risk-management techniques should not
lead us to think that we totally dominate risk, or that such a feat might be
possible some day. It is important to remember that uncertainty is our friend,
not an adversary. For example, imagine a life without uncertainties, totally
ordered and predictable, that never deviates from an average pattern. Life
without uncertainty would be like a movie whose end we already know.</p>
        <p>I believe that the best way possible for us to live in this world is something close
to the one what we have, a world where life is like a game of bridge or poker,
and not like a game of roulette. It is worth making the effort to understand the
process of evaluating and controlling risk and uncertainty because human
beings learn from experience and from technology.</p>

        <h2>Case – Project to Launch a New Product</h2><hr>
        <p>The pharmaceutical company MSS is developing a project to launch a food
supplement to be called PLQ in the market. This food supplement is added to
sugar to inhibit the development of dental caries, especially among adolescents.
Laboratory tests done up to the present have shown promising results and the
company is at the point of deciding between “going ahead with the project” or
simply abandoning it, absorbing the costs involved up to now. The company has
earlier experience in launching products and even though this is a new product
it was possible to construct a decision tree with multiple stages. This is a
problem of strategic nature for the company. The project needs to be
completed with the values of the parameters estimated based in past experience.</p>
        <p><i>The Decision Tree</i>p><hr>
        <p>To proceed with the project for launching the product it was necessary to
consider the following decision stages:</p>
        <p><b>Decision 1.</b>proceed with other “laboratory tests” to verify the toxicity (two
possible outcomes “acceptable” and “ unacceptable”) and efficacy of the
product (three possible outcomes “good”, “average”, and “bad”) or
“abandon ” the project without further laboratory tests.</p>
        <p><b>Decision 2. </b>According to the results of the laboratory tests, two possible
alternatives follows: “continue the project” doing “clinical trials” with
humans or “abandon” the project. The “clinical trials” can have two
possible results: Positive or Neutral. The results of clinical trials will be
available only after three years of testing.</p>
        <p><b>Decision 3.</b>Whatever the results of the clinical trials, it will be necessary to
decide between: “launch the product” or “abandon” the project. After
launching the project, there can be two alternatives depending on the
economic viability: Success (S) with positive gains as a result of good
acceptance of the product in the market or, Failure (F) with little or no
acceptance of the product in the market. The launch of the product will
occur only in the fourth year of the project, after the laboratory tests (1
year) and clinical trials (3 years).</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>A decision tree with 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 24 branches other than the three alternatives
to “abandon” the project is then constructed.
The values of the costs in each node of the decision tree should also be
estimated. Since the nodes of the tree are located through different future time
periods during the project, each estimated value needs to be updated to the
present moment so that it will be possible to compare all these values in the initial
period of the project. The Net Present Value (NPV) method must be used for
this purpose.</p>
        <h2>Strategy A</h2>
        <p>Taking into account that the expert estimated the probability of launching the
product with success, as P (S) = 0,7, after exploring the decision tree from the
end to the beginning, this estimate provided, for example, an Expected
Monetary Value or EMV = $979 136 and the following possible events:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
        <th>Events</th>
        <th>Probabilities</th>
        <th>Cost</th>
       <th>(Win or Lose)</th>
            </tr>
        
        <tr>
         <td>a) Abandon the project</td>   
          <td>0.416</td> 
            <td>-</td>
            <td>$47,727</td>
            </tr>
         <tr>
         <td>b) Launch the project with success</td>   
          <td>0.476</td> 
            <td></td>
            <td>$2,594,578</td>
            </tr>
         <tr>
         <td>Launch the product with failure</td>   
          <td>0.108</td> 
            <td>-</td>
            <td>$2,186,516</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
        <p>Up to this point, only one value for each cost and probability was estimated or
calculated to have a strategic decision alternative. An analysis of variation of the
results expressed in terms of EMV value, changing the values of the cost and/
or the probabilities is called Sensitivity Analysis of the project. In decision trees
of reduced size, this analysis is usually done by trying to answer the question,
“what would happen to the project result if this or that values were to occur?”
For example, let’s suppose that another strategy has been formulated.</p>
        <h2>Strategy B</h2>
        <p>If the expert suspects that after launching the product, the chances of success
or failure are equal, that is, P(Success) = P(Failure) = 0.5, redoing all the
calculations and utilizing the criterion of the greatest EMV value, we have a new
EMV value equals to $479,677 and the following events:</p><br><hr><br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Events</th>
             <th>Probabilities</th>
             <th>Cost</th>
             <th>(Win or Lose)</th>
            </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>a) Abandon the project after lab tests</td>

            <td>$47,727</td>

        <tr>
         <td>b) Launch the product with success</td>   
          <td>0.30</td>  
           <td>+</td> 
            <td>$2,594,578</td>
            </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>c) Launch the product with failure</td>   
          <td>0.10</td>  
           <td>-</td> 
            <td>$2,186,516</td>
            </tr>
                   
<tr>
      <td>d) Abandon the project after clinical trails</td>      
       <td>0.12</td>     
       <td>-</td>     
        <td>$497,982</td>    
            </tr>     
         </table>
      <p>The new estimate P(Success) = 0.5 of the probability of success after launching
the product reduced the final value of EMV, creating a new possibility (d) for
abandoning the project.</p> 
        <p>In this case, a sensitivity analysis, based on the variation of the estimates of
probabilities and costs, is extremely time-consuming. Comparison of Strategy
A and B must be done using stochastic dominance technique based in Monte
Carlo calculations. The results of this analysis can be found in Gregory (1980).</p><br>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1><hr>
        <p>Complex strategic-decision problems often require the use of multistage
decision trees. For each event located at one of the tree nodes, an estimation
of the probability values corresponding to the level of uncertainty of occurrence
of this event is calculated. The estimations of these probability values based on
historical data or subjective assessment of experts are unlikely to be efficient
because of the large number of nodes and branches of the decision tree
involved. The chain of conditional probability values formed along a branch of
the decision tree may cause difficulty to conduct the decision based on a single
value of the Expected Monetary Value.</p>
        <p>The simulation or Monte Carlo process generates a large number of random
results for the problem forming a statistically acceptable sample of the population
of events of the real problem. Simulation provides the determination of
the probability distribution of intermediate or final event of the decision process
making it possible the comparison of different strategies using the stochastic
dominance technique.</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>The decision-making process involving competition among companies can be
better understood and explained through the use of appropriate business
games. Business game is an efficient tool to create a virtual environment for
strategic competitions and can be used mainly for training purpose. Cost
restriction and the difficulty to find a business game tailored to the needs of a
company make its use more appropriate in university courses or in a specific
type of business.</p>
        <p>Continuous system models of simulation are used to analyze the overall
dynamic behavior of a system represented by a set of continuous algebraic or
differential equations. Industrial Dynamics and Business Dynamics are used to
represent and analyze the dynamic transformation of industrial and business
activities over a period of time.</p>
        <p>Simulation of real world problems involves many structured and nonstructured
parameters requiring the use of techniques of the Expert Systems and Artificial
Intelligence (Cook & Russel, 1993; Sanjay & others, 1990; Day et al., 1997).</p>
